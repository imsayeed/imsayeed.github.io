## About Me

I am a researcher in complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My research focuses on synchronization phenomena in systems with pairwise and non-pairwise interactions, including swarmalators, metapopulations, and higher-order networks.

I have published over 18 journal papers, attended multiple international conferences, and collaborated with researchers from institutes in Europe and India. I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of collective behavior in complex systems, with applications in physics, biology, and beyond.
